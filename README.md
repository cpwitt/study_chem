Suppose that you need to know how to identify a chemical compound by name (maltose) or by formula (C02).

This code is a quick throw-together solution that avoids a couple of things:

* you don't want to have to type out all those formulas
* you want the formulas to look nice and latex-y (if that's even a thing)
* you'd like to be able to keep track of which you know and which you don't and the app should adjust appropriately
